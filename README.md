I built a Nikon Service Center Clone website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The site is designed specifically for large devices and is not responsive. It features a structured layout with a header, service sections, contact details, and a footer, styled with Bootstrap components for a professional look. The design mimics a real Nikon service center website, focusing on clean UI and accessibility for desktop users.
